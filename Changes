至於 PerlYuYan / 中書珨，則是第一篇過渡情境裡的案頭詩。

就像是在對自已說，既然楚辭可以當程式跑，所以之後寫程式和寫詩的意思一樣。
寫程式將親人召喚至眼前，應與寫詩將親人召喚至眼前等價。

這確實是四歲小孩纔會有的心理狀態，但它無論如何主導了我 14~28 歲的人生過程。

(感謝 @godfat, @ilya 指正“射而不覆”，只講謎面不講謎底的習氣。)
(感謝 @alevin 指正，其中 ancient romanticist poems 已改為 ancient Hellenic tragedies。）

文章裡的“小孩”指的是我自已小時候的實際情況。

文章裡的“楚辭”和“ancient Hellenic tragedies”是我 4~11 歲最常看的文學作品之二。

文章裡的“嬸嬸叔叔姑姑姑丈”是4~8歲住在家裡照顧我的許多真實存在的人。

文章裡的“心臟病”指的是心室中隔缺損，造成心臟功率減半，無法運動也無法表現情緒，不然會暈倒。

文章裡的“案頭詩”指的是離開華文脈絡即不構成意義的程式，也就是大部分的 OurNet::* 模組。

文章裡的“詩劇”指的是 Pugs 及之後在 S-Team、CPAN、Hackage、Socialtext 等地的作品。

文章裡的“Sinthome”指的是我一直停留在 4~8 歲的心理狀態，想透過寫程式將親人召喚回身邊，
而無瑕顧及名利諸染。

於寫文章當天，發現世界己變，我不需經歷社會化之過程，即能達成二十年前之初願。

由此登入非想非非想處。

出定後，寫下定處看到的見聞，是為心慟凡例。

(Based on a conversation from http://www.plurk.com/p/2ih40z)

“其實這想法很簡單：
 NDS 上有一款 Scribblenaut 游戲，
 小孩畫什麼就會出現什麼。”

The idea is actually simple. On 兔肝猴 there's a game called 撰空, where kids
can sketch out arbitrary concepts and it would automagically manifest in-game.

“從小看楚辭長大的小孩，
 自然就會希望自己寫“昨夜西風凋碧樹”
 就真的跑出碧樹來。”

So a kid growing up reading ancient romanticist poems, would naturally wish
that penning "the sacred river Alph" and a river would actually appear.

“後來小孩長大了一點發現可以寫程式做到這件事。
 就醬。:-)”

Then the kid grew up a bit and discovered programming can actually project
infantile omnipotence into a transitional zone. That's it. :-)

                                          ...

“後來照顧小孩的叔叔姑姑伯伯嬸嬸各自搬走，
 小孩心臟病很嚴重不能旅行，
 只能寫詩想念他們。”

Shortly afterward, the kid's primary caretakers - many uncles and aunts - formed
families themselves and moved far away; the kid was born with severe ventricular
septal defect and cannot travel at all, so the kid poured wailing into poetry.

“後來發現這些詩只要押了特定的 P 韻腳，
 像是 TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, XMPP，
 就有魔力。”

After a while, the kid had a discovery: As long as the poems rhymes on -協,
such as 傳控協, 用信協, 跨協, 超文傳協 and 擴訊現協, mysterious power would
appear out of nowhere.

“後來再大一點，和其他人一起寫詩劇，
 演成噗浪和臉書，
 叔叔姑姑伯伯嬸嬸真的都進入詩的世界了。”

So the kid first wrote closet drama, and later learned to compose huge verses
based on multipart/mixed playwrights.

Then the Age of Melodrama came, and the scripts from the previous Age were
publicly performed on the stages of Twitter and Facebook.

And the Real uncles and aunts, still alive, now register into the kid's
Imaginary zone conjured from sheer Symbolic power.

“以上是對於拉岡 Sinthome 概念的實例講解。:-)”

The above is a field report illustrating Lacan's idea of 心慟. :-)

13:48 <nothingmuch> use Time::HiRes qw(time);
13:48 <audreyt> right, it's the era of 64 bits
13:49 <nothingmuch> =)
...next...
13:51  * nothingmuch will use /usr/bin/uuidgen
13:52 <nothingmuch> since there's no concept of "time" then the version you should use is competely incidential
13:52 <audreyt> I'll reserve that for my next art project. :)
...reset...
14:00 <audreyt> may I quote you (under CC0 license!) in the commit log and Changes file? :)
14:01 <nothingmuch> i relinquish all rights to my wisdom or lack thereof
14:01 <nothingmuch> (hopefully i give up responsibility too ;-)
14:02 <audreyt> you do :D there was no responsibility to begin with
...shift...
13:52 <nothingmuch> in fact, software does not exist
13:53 <audreyt> it's the very nonexistence that makes it work... that is the essence of मध्यमिक
13:53 <audreyt> Nagarjuna was very much a hacker
13:54 <audreyt> it's said that Nagarjuna comprehended pretty much everything, and practiced shadow nijutsu and hacked into the 
                royal residence during adolescence
13:54 <audreyt> along with a peer, who got caught by the royal guard and promptedly killed
13:55 <audreyt> so Nagarjuna sat down and wrote Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way and Seventy Verses on Emptiness, 
                effectively hacked the indic culture into Hegel's shape, just much earlier...
13:56 <audreyt> then Tang XuanZang ported it to Chinese during Emperor Lee's reign (Tang and Lee happens to be my parents' 
                families)
13:56 <audreyt> as the Heart Sutra
13:57 <audreyt> "Essence of Wisdom Sutra", which is chanted everyday in CJKV by common people
13:57 <audreyt> I ported that to Unix a couple weeks ago as 
13:57 <audreyt>     sync;sync;shutdown -k;halt -lnqu
...comefrom...
14:02 <audreyt> "sync; sync; sudo sync; sudo shutdown -k; sudo halt -lnqu"
14:03 <audreyt> was my (working) translation
...goto...
13:58 <audreyt> which is what I now use daily whenever I get into an online situation where flamewar is immediate
13:58 <audreyt> ...so I gets (as promised by the Sutra) absolute immunity over flamewars
13:58 <nothingmuch> §=)
13:58 <audreyt> ...now I'd just have to do that again in realspace too :)
13:58 <audreyt> .
13:58 <nothingmuch> i wonder what that typo means
13:59 <nothingmuch> perhaps it's an enlightened smiley
13:59 <audreyt> converging infinity? :)
13:59 <audreyt> yeah, it's beautiful
...last...
14:04 <audreyt> well, translations evolve, too :) we'll probably revisit many times with reified control...
14:05 <audreyt> in realspace though, it's 10pm and I gotta go home and sleep. ttyl!
14:05 <nothingmuch> ciao ciao
14:05 <nothingmuch> i need to do laundry and rehearse myself
14:06 <audreyt> :D see ya!
